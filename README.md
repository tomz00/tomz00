Hey! 👋

I'm Tomas from Slovakia.

I use GitHub mainly to manage and maintain my private repositories, where I keep the projects and tools I work on. In the past, I also helped by translating a few open-source projects here on GitHub.

You'll also find a few public repositories on my profile. Most of them are things I made while learning, experimenting, or solving some problems. I kept them public in case they help someone else.

With that said, I'm not really a software developer. I enjoy DevOps, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and similar areas. I also run a bunch of self-hosted services at home. On my Raspberry Pi, I run an SDR dongle with an ADS-B antenna that feeds data to Flightradar24 and other similar sites.
